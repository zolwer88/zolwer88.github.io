“The World’s Most Traveled Dog”
by Richard Bauman
 

1	
In the predawn darkness, the scruffy little dog scurried up the ship’s gangplank. But he wasn’t a stowaway. On that August morning in 1895, he was beginning a journey as a registered mail package headed for Japan. It wasn’t his first adventure traveling with the mail and it wouldn’t be his last. But it would be his longest. And when it was over, he would be world-famous.

2	
Owney was a stray who had captured the hearts of postal workers and the public and become the mascot for the Railway Mail Service. Various accounts tell how one day in 1888 Owney had walked into the post office in Albany, New York, and fallen asleep on a mailbag. When he awoke, he apparently decided the post office was his new home. Recognizing that he wasn’t likely to leave, the 30 or so postal workers fed him, played with him, and gave him a place to sleep. Owney’s favorite bed was a mailbag.

3	
As mailbags were being loaded into the rail car one day, he jumped aboard unnoticed. He was missed only after the train was long gone. Thus, Owney’s first mail car excursion was a 150-mile jaunt south to New York City.

4	
Postal workers in New York City wired the Albany Post Office to say Owney was there and to ask what they should do about him. Albany postal workers replied: Mail him back to Albany. Once Owney returned home, someone at the post office realized he might take off again. And so Owney was given a leather collar with a tag asking that he be “mailed” back to the Albany Post Office.

5	
The wanderlust bug had seriously infected Owney. It wasn’t long before he took off on another adventure aboard another railroad mail car. For the next nine years he would travel throughout the United States and do it all “by mail.” Between outings he would return to his friends at the Albany Post Office.

6	
The label on Owney’s collar asked for mail tags to mark his travels. This request was honored in stellar fashion. In all, he collected 1,017 different tags from friends and post offices in the U.S. and other countries, too. Those tags are a pretty good record of his travels. Most of them still survive and validate his visits to such cities as Denver, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, San Francisco, Nashville, Baltimore, Grand Rapids, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, El Paso, and Rock Island.

7	
Most postal workers welcomed Owney in the railroad mail car. He kept them company as they sorted mail while traveling from town to town. Besides liking the little brown mutt, the railroad postal workers perceived him as a good-luck talisman. In the late 1800s there were about 400 train wrecks each year, but not one of the trains Owney rode on was ever involved in an accident.

8	
On that August day in 1895 when Owney arrived in Tacoma, Washington, he was traveling “first class”—that is, he was traveling with the first-class mailbags. But though he arrived in town by train, he left aboard a steamship. It was the beginning of an around-the-world extravaganza that would earn Owney the title of the World’s Most Traveled Dog.

9	
At four in the morning on 19 August, Owney boarded the steamship Victoria along with 24 sacks of mail. His friends in Albany had provided him with a tiny suitcase that contained a sleeping blanket (even though he preferred mailbags), along with a comb and a brush so he could always look his finest. He was sent registered mail as a “Registered Dog Package.” It assured he would receive special care on the Washington to Japan leg of his journey.

10	
Owney was well received in Japan. One report states he met the emperor, who added a tag to Owney’s jacket. Another report says a representative of the emperor greeted him. In either event, it’s known that the Japanese issued Owney an official passport cautioning him against driving wagons too fast on narrow roads and refraining from writing on the walls of public buildings. From Japan, he sailed to Shanghai and then to Foochow, China.

11	
In Foochow he was entertained aboard the United States Navy cruiser Detroit and given a ribbon by the ship’s officers. He continued westward, collecting medals and tags along the way. From Singapore he sailed across the Indian Ocean to Perim at the mouth of the Red Sea, and through the Suez Canal. He stopped briefly at the Mediterranean port of Algiers and at São Miguel in the Azores.

12	
The steamer Port Phillip carried him across the Atlantic to the U.S. He arrived in New York, his home state, on 24 December, 1895. It was the end of a 132-day adventure. Owney was apparently none the worse for the trip.

13	
It is estimated that during his lifetime Owney traveled more than 143,000 miles, most of it in railroad mail cars. And this is where his story would end if it hadn’t been for a book and a teacher’s classroom project.

14	
In 1977, Owney the Traveling Dog by Lynn Hall was published. After her class read Hall’s book in 1996, Bev Adams, a schoolteacher in Camarillo, California, developed the Traveling Owney Project. Intrigued with the tale of Owney’s travels, her students created an Owney of their own, a large stuffed toy dog. The project’s goal was for the new Owney to visit one classroom in each of the 50 states and do it within a school year. The children in each classroom would learn about the places Owney visited, calculate the miles he’d traveled, and find out about weather and geography in other parts of the country.

15	
During the 2003-2004 school year, Owney visited all 50 states. Owney travels in a large cardboard box, stays just one day in a classroom, and the next day is mailed to the next school on the itinerary. In response to Owney’s visit, each classroom sends postcards to the other participating schools to share news of Owney’s progress.

16	
In the late 1800s a lot of people heard about Owney’s travels. Yet probably nobody then could have imagined that a little mutt of unknown pedigree would become famous, travel around the world, and then in the 21st century become a teacher, too!

“The Pedestrians”
by Timothy Tocher
 

1	
Each time Helga Estby looked over her shoulder, the big cat was there. Crossing Wyoming’s Red Desert on foot, in the dust and heat of August 1896, was tough. Being stalked by a mountain lion made it frightening as well. Stopping before dark, Helga and her eighteen-year-old daughter, Clara, built a fire. When the sun rose, the lion was nowhere to be seen.

2	
How did two women end up alone in the desert? In the early 1890s, Helga Estby lived with her husband and nine children on a small farm outside of Spokane, Washington. Ole Estby worked the land and earned money as a carpenter in the city. Helga raised the children, helped with farm chores, and took care of the house. With everyone pitching in, the family stayed one step ahead of the bank, which held a mortgage on their property.

3	
Then the country was hit with a depression1. An injury left Ole unfit to do heavy work. Soon the Estbys were in debt and unable to pay their mortgage. Helga decided it was up to her to save their home.

4	
Helga heard that an anonymous person connected to the fashion industry out East was sponsoring a prize of $10,000 for any woman who could walk from Washington State to New York City, a distance of 3,500 miles, in seven months. Traditionally, women wore long skirts that dragged on the ground. These garments restricted movement. The prize sponsor was promoting a modern outfit called the bicycle skirt that left women’s ankles exposed, freeing them to walk or pedal without being tripped by their clothing. Leggings were worn underneath to protect modesty.

5	
To prove their fitness, women were walking long distances. Nicknamed “pedestrians” by the newspapers of the day, they argued that women were equal to men and should be granted the right to vote. Some pedestrians had walked hundreds of miles, but none had ever attempted a cross-country trek.

6	
Helga accepted the challenge and invited her adventurous daughter Clara to come along. The rules stated that they could not carry more than five dollars each in cash. They were not allowed to beg, and would have to earn any money needed along the way. 

7	
Helga and Clara, still clad in traditional long dresses, left Spokane on May 5, each carrying an eight-pound satchel. Helga’s bag contained a notebook, a pen, and a letter from the mayor stating that the women were of good character. Clara packed a sketch pad, a curling iron for her hair, and a spray gun loaded with pepper to ward off animal or human pests. Both carried a stack of photos of themselves, which they hoped to sell as souvenirs. 

8	
It rained for all but three of the first thirty days of their journey. Weighted down by their waterlogged, long dresses, the women slogged an average of twenty-seven miles each day. Exhaustion allowed them to sleep in the most uncomfortable conditions.

9	
At a store in Salt Lake City, Utah, they were given the bicycle skirt and leggings outfits they would wear for the rest of the trip. Once again they had a photograph taken and bought copies to sell. 

10	
Helga and Clara followed the train route across rivers, over mountains, and into valleys. The cinders scattered alongside the tracks wore their shoes to tatters. It would take them eight pairs each to complete the journey. 

11	
Towns and cities had grown along the tracks. Whenever possible, the ladies had a mayor or state governor sign Helga’s notebook as proof that they had passed through. 

12	
Most of their encounters with people were friendly. Families offered them shelter for the night in either a house or barn. Often a home-cooked meal was exchanged for an account of their adventures. When all else failed, they slept in maintenance sheds along the tracks.

13	
In each city along the route, Helga and Clara visited a newspaper office. Most editors were happy to print a story about the intrepid pedestrians. The publicity sold photographs and encouraged people to help them. Still there were problems.

14	
To walk 3,500 miles in seven months meant averaging more than sixteen miles per day. When Clara sprained her ankle, the women were forced to rest for ten days. The agreement allowed extra time for “illness,” but would an injury be excused?

15	
On December 23, Helga and Clara reached Manhattan, completing what had seemed an impossible journey. At the offices of the New York World, the country’s most popular newspaper, they were greeted with great fanfare. Helga and Clara were featured in every newspaper in the city.

16	
Christmas Eve was a different day. Their mysterious sponsor announced that the $10,000 would not be paid since the walk took eighteen days longer than the time limit. With no money for train tickets, Helga and Clara were forced to remain in New York.

17	
Rolling up their sleeves, they worked any jobs they could find. They moved from Manhattan to Brooklyn, where rents were cheaper, yet their wages barely covered room and board. It was impossible to save enough for train fare home. 

18	
An article in the New York Sun newspaper saved the day. Chauncy Depew, a wealthy New Yorker who owned a railroad that ran from New York to Chicago, took pity on the pedestrians. He gave Helga and Clara free passage.

19	
Years after Helga and Clara finally arrived home, Helga’s daughter-in-law Margaret found a scrapbook with a few newspaper clippings from the long trek. Fascinated, she hid them for safekeeping. Years later, when all of Helga and Ole’s children had passed away, she gave the scrapbook to Helga’s granddaughter Thelma. Thelma’s granddaughter later wrote a school report on her great-great-grandmother’s amazing feat. Her grandson made it the subject of a Washington State History Day project. As people learned of Helga’s adventure, they scoured old newspaper files for more details. The story that was nearly forgotten had been reclaimed. 

20	
Helga Estby and Clara proved that women were strong and resourceful. The hundreds of women they met, and the thousands more who read of their feat in newspapers, saw that their own lives could be different from those of generations that came before. In 1920, after passage of the constitutional amendment giving women the vote, Helga and Clara joined millions of other American women in casting their ballots for president of the United States.
